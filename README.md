# NoPrefixSet

There is a given list of strings where each string contains only lowercase letters from 
`a - j`, inclusive. 
The set of strings is said to be a `GOOD SET` if no string is a prefix of another string.
In this case, print GOOD SET. Otherwise, print `BAD SET` on the first line followed 
by the string being checked.

Note If two strings are identical, they are prefixes of each other.

**NB:** A more efficient approach involves using TrieNode ds
